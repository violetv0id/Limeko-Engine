Welcome to the official documentation of Limeko!

Let's get straight to the point;



\# == Downloading Limeko

To get started, you'll first need to download a version of Limeko.



1: Visit the GitHub, and download the latest 'STABLE' version for your OS in 'Releases'.

2: Once your download finishes, unzip it, and run the executable.

3: Follow the steps below to create your first project!





\# == Creating a Project

Projects in Limeko allow you to split your work and projects cleanly.



If you're coming from Unity, you may see the Rendering-Pipeline Presets (RPPs), and connect the two.

However; Limeko only has one Rendering-Pipeline.



RPPs are simply \*Presets\* for one Rendering-Pipeline. These make getting your project ready both easier and faster.

Before picking an RPP, read each one's description, or see 'Picking a Rendering-Pipeline Preset'.
